### User Interface

As DCList.net we're trying to keep our UI as simple and easy to understand as possible. We have 99% responsible UI and works ideal with all devices, But we are far away from perfect.

### Multi Language Support

### Charts and Analytics

We have two public charts for bot analytics, view and vote count. Those charts are visible by any user. Besides, we have bunch of private charts and analytics for bot owners.

Also, you can access public charts in png, svg and json format through our chart api. There is a detailed explanation how to use it on here [Chart API](https://google.com).

### Easy Verification Process

It's super easy to add new bot in DCList. All you have to do is fill required fields and submit. Generally, bot verification requests results within 24 hours.

When our verificators make a decision about your bot you will get a notification from either email or in-site [notification system](#customizable-notifications).

If your request approved, you can start using bot owner only features of DCList, But if your request was rejected, you can look at reason of rejection on your bot's page.

After fixing the issue with your bot, you can re-submit for verification request without losing any data or re-filling previous "Add Bot" form.

:::caution If your bot get rejected, you have one week to make it approved. After one week, your bot's data will be suspended. :::


### Customizable Notifications

Also, if you add an email to your account, you can get notifications via email. You can customize email notification settings as well.
