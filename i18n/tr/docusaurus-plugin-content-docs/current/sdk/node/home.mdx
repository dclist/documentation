## Installation {#installation}

You can easily install and start using dclist.net nodejs sdk. Sdk is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com).

You copy-paste following commands to install :


```bash
npm i --save @dclist/sdk
```

OR

```bash
yarn add @dclist/sdk
```

## Start Coding {#start-coding}

**We support typescript natively. You don't need to install any other packages.**

If you want to learn more about sdk. You can take a look at our [Advanced Guides](sdk/node/advanced)

### Creating Client {#creating-client}

Gateway client is the ultimate client for using dclist's api. You can do tons of things with it. We are going to learn more about it later.

Simply you can create GatewayClient using your bot's dclist token.

:::info DCList Token You can obtain or regenerate your bot's dclist token in your bot's settings page under "**Api Settings**". :::<Tabs groupId="programming-language" defaultValue="ts" values={[

<TabItem value="ts">

```ts
import { GatewayClient } from '@dclist/sdk'

const dclClient = new GatewayClient({
token: 'YOUR_DCLIST_TOKEN_HERE'
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
const { GatewayClient } = require('@dclist/sdk')

const dclClient = new GatewayClient({
token: 'YOUR_DCLIST_TOKEN_HERE'
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Interacting with API {#interacting-with-api}

You can easily interact with our graphql api using GatewayClient. Here is a simple example :

```ts
// To get bot by discord id
dclClient.getBotById('690214077490004030')

// To get user by discord id
dclClient.getUserById('690214077490004030')

// To check is user voted recently
dclClient.isUserVoted('690214077490004030')
```

### Subscribing to Events

You can also subscribe to events like new votes via GatewayClient. You don't have to set up a server to just receive new votes. It would be a waste of resource. Insted of you can simply call #subscribeTo function to listen for new event. Smart, isn't it.<Tabs groupId="programming-language" defaultValue="ts" values={[
{ label: 'Typescript', value: 'ts' },
{ 'JavaScript', 'js' }, ]} mark =crwd-mark>
<TabItem value="ts">

```ts
import { SubscriptionsTopicsEnum } from '@dclist/sdk'

dclClient.subscribeTo([SubscriptionsTopicsEnum.NEW_VOTE])

dclClient.on(SubscriptionsTopicsEnum.NEW_VOTE, (voteObj) => {
/* Do something with voteObj */
/* For example, send message to log channel  */
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
dclClient.subscribeTo(['SDK_NEW_VOTE'])

dclClient.on('SDK_NEW_VOTE', (voteObj) => {
/* Do something with voteObj */
/* For example, send message to log channel  */
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
